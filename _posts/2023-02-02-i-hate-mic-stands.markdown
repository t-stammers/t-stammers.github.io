got an interesting recording job coming up. i engineer at a super tiny venue called the camden chapel, and an artist has requested that we multitrack their performance for a video they're doing.

their drum setup is what's most interesting to me. snare, hihat, splash and an spd sampler. whilst that's all very straightforward, the issue is mic stands. anyone who's had the misfortune of transporting mic stands knows they're the worst thing ever, and i've been racking my brain to try and figure out how to avoid bringing my own ones to the venue.

this abomination.


oktava mk-012 pencil condenser as an overhead, and this super cool old AKG D190E on snare. the AKG is really dark sounding, should sound awesome on snare drum, and the mk-012 will work great as a mono overhead for the cymbals, and best of all, it all fits on a single mic stand! all it took was some electrical tape and creative use of mic clips and thread adapters!
