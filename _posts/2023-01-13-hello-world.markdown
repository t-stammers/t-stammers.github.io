hello world! 

i decided that throughout 2023 i was going to make more of an effort to record my thoughts, so here we are. i’ve never been great at sticking to new years resolutions, so there’s a not insignificant chance i’ll have forgotten about this whole thing by february, but hey, figured it’d still be worth giving it a try.

i've got a few topics in mind, i think my first proper post after this one will be about my band, [lunetta](https://www.instagram.com/lunettalunettalunetta/), and the development of our first single, [bloom](https://open.spotify.com/track/6jlOdVWFQCu2X8R7xpIWFK?si=8e4bb02e672b4ffe), which came out at the end of last year. i’ll probably show off some of the early demos to the track and talk through how it came to be.

in other news though, here's some photos of a classical recording session i ran at vestry hall in ealing! piano, flute, classical vocals and percussion! i love recording!
