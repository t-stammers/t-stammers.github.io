super super quick one today, been mixing the new lunetta release, and came up with what i think is the coolest delay throw chain. echoboy doing the delay, little radiator adding some drive, pro q 3 and pro c 2 to get it cutting through the mix and little microshift doing some stereo widening. very fun!
